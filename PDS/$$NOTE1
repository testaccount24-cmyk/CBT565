Hi Sam,

Here's the last installment on documentation for my files unless
I happen across something else by accident in the next 38 days or
so.  It is an XMIT of a PDS that contains:

    CCLASS ---> should be $$README in the CCLASS library within
             FILE 565
    CLASS  ---> should be $$README in the CLASS library within
             FILE 565
    DUMPCLAS ----> should be the $$README in the DUMPCLAS library
             within FILE 565
    FILE565 ----> should be the $$README in FILE 565 itself. It
             is actually the sum of the above three.
    TEXTBOOK ---> should be TEXTBOOK in the DUMPCLAS library
             within FILE 565. It is an XMIT of a
             DSORG=PS,RECFM=FBA,LRECL=133 dataset containing the
             class textbook.

Thanks again for your good work,
Dick
