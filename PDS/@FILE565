//***FILE 565 is from Dick Thornton, who is the author of the       *   FILE 565
//*           DISASSEMBLER program on File 217, and his new         *   FILE 565
//*           DISASSEMBLER program on File 234.  This is his        *   FILE 565
//*           collection of classes he has either given, or was     *   FILE 565
//*           planning to give.                                     *   FILE 565
//*                                                                 *   FILE 565
//*           There are 3 members in this file, which are           *   FILE 565
//*           IEBUPDTE-unloaded pds'es, and if you use the          *   FILE 565
//*           PDSLOAD command instead of IEBUPDTE, you will         *   FILE 565
//*           also get ISPF statistics in each pds.  See member     *   FILE 565
//*           $PDSLOAD for a job to produce the 3 pds'es.           *   FILE 565
//*                                                                 *   FILE 565
//*           You will have to re-sort the members of these         *   FILE 565
//*           pds'es for yourself, because the members get          *   FILE 565
//*           listed in EBCDIC collating sequence, of course,       *   FILE 565
//*           and they may not have been presented to the           *   FILE 565
//*           students in this order.  Please examine the doc       *   FILE 565
